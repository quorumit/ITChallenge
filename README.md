We need to build an application that can show crypto currency using a specific API given by us. 

The application will have the next functionalities:

  - Select a crypto coin and see its information

  - Select a crypto coin and display its price and price variation in a time period interval


Using this API https://www.coingecko.com/es/api/documentation:


Build a functionality that allow a user to select from a dropdown menu a coin and see its following information:

  - symbol

  - name

  - image

  - current_price (USD)

  - current_price (ARS)

  - low_24h (USD)

  - low_24h (ARS)

  - high_24h (USD)

  - high_24h (ARS)

Build a functionality that allow a user to select a coin based on the following criteria:

  - Coin name

  - Coin currency (USD, ARS)

  - Days ago (1, 14, 30)

Display the found data in a table with the following columns:

  - Coin price

With the table data, create a line chart that shows the variation of the price by day.
